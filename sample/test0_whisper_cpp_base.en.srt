1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,920
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,740
We speak of AI when computer systems
perform tasks that usually require human
intelligence.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,220
This includes, for example, recognising
images, making decisions or engaging in
dialogue.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,340
To do this, the AI systems must be
equipped with knowledge and experience.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,100
This can be achieved in two ways.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,400
You can program each individual
instruction so that the machine solves the
task step by step.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,580
This is comparable to a cooking recipe or
assembly instructions.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,140
Alternatively, you can use programs that
learn from data themselves.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,960
This enables them to detect relevant
information, draw conclusions, or make
predictions.

10
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,220
This is known as machine learning.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,460
We all have probably dealt with AI at some
point in our lives.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,220
When we watch films, listen to music or
shop online, AI gives us recommendations
about what we might like.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,940
AI is capable of converting spoken
language into text and translating it into
other languages.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,440
AI is a central component of robotics.
Robots make our everyday lives easier or
take on strenuous activities.

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,000
Self-driving vehicles recognise their
environment through AI and can react to
it.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,180
AI is becoming increasingly important
within medicine.

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,100
It supports doctors when diagnosing
diseases.

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,500
Also, more and more patients use AI-based
apps for initial diagnosis.

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,080
In the educational sector, AI helps to
individualise learning activities, for
example, on digital learning platforms.

20
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,600
AI is becoming increasingly important.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,380
Once we understand how AI works, we can
better gauge where it can support everyday
activities at home and at work.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,780
And where we would rather make our own
decisions.

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,660
AI will not replace humans, but it is
getting better and better at supporting
us.

24
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,120
For this, we need an AI-competent society.
