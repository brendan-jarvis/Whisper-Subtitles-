00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,080
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,340
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,020
We speak of AI when computer systems
perform tasks that usually require human
intelligence.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,520
This includes, for example, recognizing
images, making decisions, or engaging in
dialogue.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,760
To do this, the AI systems must be
equipped with knowledge and experience.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,400
This can be achieved in two ways.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,580
You can program each individual
instruction so that the machine solves the
task step by step.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,940
This is comparable to a cooking recipe or
assembly instructions.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,620
Alternatively, you can use programs that
learn from data themselves.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,260
This enables them to detect relevant
information, draw conclusions, or make
predictions.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,460
This is known as machine learning.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,640
We all have probably dealt with AI at some
point in our lives.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,540
When we watch films, listen to music, or
shop online, AI gives us recommendations
about what we might like.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,260
AI is capable of converting spoken
language into text and translating it into
other languages.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,100
AI is a central component of robotics.

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,960
Robots make our everyday lives easier or
take on strenuous activities.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,340
Self-driving vehicles recognize their
environment through AI and can react to
it.

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,380
AI is becoming increasingly important
within medicine.

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,500
It supports doctors when diagnosing
diseases.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,900
Also, more and more patients use AI-based
apps for initial diagnosis.

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,660
In the educational sector, AI helps to
individualize learning activities,

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,480
for example on digital learning platforms.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,940
AI is becoming increasingly important.

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,840
Once we understand how AI works, we can
better gauge where it can support everyday
activities

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,060
at home and at work, and where we would
rather make our own decisions.

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,820
AI will not replace humans, but it is
getting better and better at supporting
us.

27
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,460
For this, we need an AI competent society.
