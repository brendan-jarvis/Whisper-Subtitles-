1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:17.120
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?

2
0:00:17.120 --> 0:00:21.800
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again.

3
0:00:21.800 --> 0:00:26.120
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin?

4
0:00:26.120 --> 0:00:29.800
Like a house apart, one blow from caving in.

5
0:00:29.800 --> 0:00:30.300
Do you?
