1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,260
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We speak of AI when computer systems perform
 that usually require human intelligence.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,480
This includes, for example, recognizing
 making decisions or engaging in dialogue.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,700
To do this, the AI systems must be equipped
 knowledge and experience.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,340
This can be achieved in two ways.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,380
You can program each individual instruction
 that the machine solves the task step

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,420
You can program each individual instruction
 that the machine solves the task step
 step.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:39,880
This is comparable to a cooking recipe
 assembly instructions.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:44,460
Alternatively, you can use programs that
 from data themselves.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:50,180
This enables them to detect relevant information,
 conclusions or make predictions.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,360
This is known as machine learning.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:58,640
We all have probably dealt with AI at
 point in our lives.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
When we watch films, listen to music or
 online.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:05,400
AI gives us recommendations about what
 might like.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:13,040
AI is capable of converting spoken language
 text and translating it into other languages.

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,920
AI is a central component of robotics.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:24,920
Robots make our everyday lives easier
 take on strenuous activities.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:31,180
Self-driving vehicles recognise their
 through AI and can react to it.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:35,300
AI is becoming increasingly important
 medicine.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:38,420
It supports doctors when diagnosing diseases.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:46,780
Also, more and more patients use AI-based
 for initial diagnosis.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:52,520
In the educational sector, AI helps to
 learning activities,

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:55,340
for example, on digital learning platforms.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,980
AI is becoming increasingly important.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Once we understand how AI works, we can
 gauge where it can support everyday activities

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:08,940
at home and at work, and where we would
 make our own decisions.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:14,780
AI will not replace humans, but it is
 better and better at supporting us.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:18,420
For this, we need an AI-competent society.
