1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,260
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,000
We speak of AI when computer systems
perform tasks that usually require human
intelligence.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,480
This includes, for example, recognizing
images, making decisions or engaging in
dialogue.

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,700
To do this, the AI systems must be
equipped with knowledge and experience.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,340
This can be achieved in two ways.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,420
You can program each individual
instruction so that the machine solves the
task step by step.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,880
This is comparable to a cooking recipe or
assembly instructions.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,460
Alternatively, you can use programs that
learn from data themselves.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,180
This enables them to detect relevant
information, draw conclusions or make
predictions.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,360
This is known as machine learning.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,640
We all have probably dealt with AI at some
point in our lives.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,040
When we watch films, listen to music or
shop online.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,400
AI gives us recommendations about what we
might like.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,040
AI is capable of converting spoken
language into text and translating it into
other languages.

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,920
AI is a central component of robotics.

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,920
Robots make our everyday lives easier or
take on strenuous activities.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,180
Self-driving vehicles recognise their
environment through AI and can react to
it.

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,300
AI is becoming increasingly important
within medicine.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,420
It supports doctors when diagnosing
diseases.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,780
Also, more and more patients use AI-based
apps for initial diagnosis.

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,520
In the educational sector, AI helps to
individualise learning activities,

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,340
for example, on digital learning
platforms.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,980
AI is becoming increasingly important.

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,840
Once we understand how AI works, we can
better gauge where it can support everyday
activities

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,940
at home and at work, and where we would
rather make our own decisions.

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,780
AI will not replace humans, but it is
getting better and better at supporting
us.

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,420
For this, we need an AI-competent society.
